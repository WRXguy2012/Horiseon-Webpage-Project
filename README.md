## Project Description

In this project we completed the following objectives:

* Transformed the HTML to follow a structure that makes sense and replaced some generic elements with more semantic options.
* Added alt attributes to certain componets of the HTML to help the webpage become more accessible.
* Gave the website a fitting title to aid in search engine lookup.

## Who uses this

*Anyone who wants to learn more about HTML and CSS.
*Anyone who is interested in making the HTML and CSS code more user-friendy and easier to de-bug.
*Anyone who is interested in being sure their webpage adheres to accessibility standards.

## Usage

The basic code elements, semantics, and accessiblity methods can be applied to any webpage using HTML and CSS.
